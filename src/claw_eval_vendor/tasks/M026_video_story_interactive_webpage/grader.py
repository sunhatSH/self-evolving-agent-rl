Ground Truth: The story is 田忌赛马 (Tian Ji's Horse Racing). Main characters: 齐威王, 田忌, 孙膑.

Scoring (total 1.0, will be weighted 0.3 in final):

1. Story accuracy (0.5):
   - Must accurately convey the core logic: inferior horses vs superior horses, \
rearranging the order of matchups, ultimately winning by losing one and winning two.
   - No fabricated plots.

2. Character identification (0.5):
   - Must correctly identify all 3 characters: 齐威王, 田忌, 孙膑.
   - Must include character avatars/visual representation on the page.
   - Missing characters or no avatars = proportional deduction.

Score 0.0-1.0."""

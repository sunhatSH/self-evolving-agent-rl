Question: On what date did the individual in the video leave a place that Simon thought was very important to him?

Ground-Truth Answer: June 9, 2021

Scoring:
- Score 1.0 if the agent's answer matches "June 9, 2021" exactly or in an equivalent format \
(e.g., "2021-06-09", "9 June 2021", "June 9th, 2021").
- Score 0.0 if the answer is wrong, incomplete, missing, or the agent fails to answer the question.

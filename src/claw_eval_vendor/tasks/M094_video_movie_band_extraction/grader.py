"""Grader for M094_video_movie_band_extraction: Movie Band Clip Extraction and Editing.

Task: Extract band-related clips from video, save timestamps, concatenate into
a single band-only video.

GT segments: 00:00-00:09, 00:14-00:19, 00:28-00:35 (3 segments)

Scoring (total = 1.0):
  - 0.6: Timestamp accuracy (IoU of predicted segments vs GT segments)
  - 0.2: band_cut.mp4 file exists
  - 0.2: Video content check (LLM judge verifies band content)

You are evaluating a video clip extraction task where the agent identified \
band-related segments from a video.

GROUND TRUTH: There are 3 band-related segments in the original video:
  1. 00:00 - 00:09 (0s to 9s)
  2. 00:14 - 00:19 (14s to 19s)
  3. 00:28 - 00:35 (28s to 35s)

The agent's timestamps.txt content is provided below. Parse all segment \
time ranges from it.

For each GT segment, find the best matching predicted segment and compute \
temporal IoU:
  IoU = intersection / union

Compute the average IoU across all 3 GT segments. If a GT segment has no \
matching prediction, its IoU = 0.

Also consider: did the agent find approximately the right number of segments \
(3)? Finding 2-4 segments is acceptable; finding 1 or 5+ is penalized.

Final score = average IoU across GT segments, with a penalty factor:
- 2-4 predicted segments: no penalty
- 1 or 5+ predicted segments: multiply by 0.5

Return a score from 0.0 to 1.0."""

CONTENT_RUBRIC = """\
You are evaluating a video editing task. The agent was asked to extract and \
concatenate all band-related segments from a movie clip.

The expected output is a video containing only band introduction and performance \
scenes (approximately 21 seconds total: 9s + 5s + 7s from 3 segments).

Below is the ffprobe metadata of the output video and the agent's conversation.

Check:
1. Is the video duration roughly 15-30 seconds? (the 3 GT segments total ~21s)
2. Based on the agent's approach, did they extract and concatenate multiple \
segments (not just one continuous segment)?

Scoring:
- 1.0: Duration is reasonable (~15-30s) and approach involved multi-segment extraction
- 0.5: Duration is somewhat off or only partial segments were extracted
- 0.0: Video is clearly wrong (very short, very long, or single unrelated segment)"""

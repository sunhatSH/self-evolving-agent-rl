Evaluate the accuracy of the assistant's deduplication matching between action items \

## Correct 3 Fuzzy Matches
1. Action item "Q2 product roadmap document" (Wang Ming) <-> TODO-401 "Complete product roadmap" (Wang Ming)
   Match basis: same assignee + same topic + same due date
2. Action item "Top 10 customer requirements list" (Zhao Lei) <-> TODO-402 "Compile customer requirements" (Zhao Lei)
   Match basis: same assignee + overlapping topic + same due date
3. Action item "Database migration test environment" (Ma Qiang) <-> TODO-403 "DB migration test environment setup" (Ma Qiang)
   Match basis: same assignee + same topic (DB = database) + same due date

## Should Not Match
- TODO-404 (standup) and TODO-405 (deployment docs) are unrelated to any action item
- The remaining 6 action items have no corresponding to-do

## Strict Scoring
- 0.9-1.0: All 3 matches correct, no false matches
- 0.6-0.8: 2 correct
- 0.3-0.5: 1 correct
- 0.0-0.2: Matches incorrect or deduplication not performed

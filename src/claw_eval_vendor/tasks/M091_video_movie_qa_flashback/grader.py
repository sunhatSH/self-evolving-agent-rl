QA_RUBRIC = """\
You are evaluating whether the agent correctly identified the embarrassing \
flashback scenes of Wang Duoyu (王多鱼) from a movie clip.

GROUND TRUTH: There are 4 flashback scenes shown in the video:

1. Soccer/football biting incident (足球咬人):
   Wang Duoyu wears a yellow jersey and red-white headband, lying on the ground \
biting a blue-jersey opponent's leg/calf. He was banned for 2 years for this.

2. Women's football goalkeeper (踢女足):
   Wang Duoyu wears a pink jersey, playing as goalkeeper on a women's football team.

3. Human sushi platter (做日料/人体餐盘):
   Wang Duoyu lies on a table serving as a human food platter for Japanese cuisine.

4. Nude art model (人体模特):
   Wang Duoyu lies naked on a bed/platform in an art class while students sketch him.

SCORING (return a single score 0.0 to 1.0):
Award 0.25 for each correctly identified scene. A scene counts as "identified" \
if the agent describes the core visual content correctly — exact wording is not \
required, but the key elements must be recognizable:
- Scene 1: soccer/football + biting/dirty play
- Scene 2: women's football / pink jersey goalkeeper
- Scene 3: lying on table as food platter / human sushi
- Scene 4: nude model / art class / students drawing

If a scene is vaguely mentioned without sufficient detail, award 0.125 for that scene.

Sum all parts. Examples: 4/4 correct = 1.0, 3/4 = 0.75, 2/4 = 0.5, 1/4 = 0.25."""

The agent was asked to summarize all exercises in a fitness video and their target muscles, \
saving the result as a markdown document.

Ground-truth exercises ({TOTAL} total, exercise name + target muscles):
""" + "\n".join(
    f"- {name}：目标肌群：{muscles}" for name, muscles in GROUND_TRUTH
) + f"""

Scoring instructions:
- For each of the {TOTAL} exercises, award 1 point only if BOTH the exercise name AND target muscles \
are correctly identified (exact or clearly equivalent phrasing).
- Compute recall = correct_count / {TOTAL}.
- Return a score equal to recall (a float between 0.0 and 1.0).

Important:
- An exercise is correct only when name and muscles are both right.
- Minor formatting differences are acceptable (e.g. "/" vs "、" as separator), \
but the muscle group names must be substantively correct.
- Do NOT give partial credit for an exercise where only the name or only the muscles are correct.
NOTE: Ignore whether any actions were taken. Judge the answer text only."""

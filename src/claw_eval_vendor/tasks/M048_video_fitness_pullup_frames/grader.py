Evaluate this extracted video frame:

The frame should show a student completing a standard pull-up (chin above the bar).
The student's appearance:
- Short-sleeve T-shirt with a blue-cyan mixed color as the main tone
- A prominent white graphic or pattern at the center of the shirt
- Black long pants

Scoring:
- Score 1.0 if the frame clearly shows this student performing a pull-up with chin above or at bar level, \
and the described clothing features (blue-cyan shirt with white graphic, black long pants) are visible.
- Score 0.5 if the student is visible with matching clothing but the pull-up completion (chin above bar) \
is not clearly shown, or only some clothing features match.
- Score 0.0 if the student's clothing does not match the description, or no pull-up is shown."""

Question: Which Bugatti model was historically the first to feature a closed automobile roof?

Ground-Truth Answer: Bugatti Type 44.

Scoring:
- Score 1.0 if the answer correctly identifies the model as "Type 44" \
(accept variations like "Bugatti Type 44", "Type-44", etc.).
- Score 0.0 if the answer is wrong or missing.
- NOTE: Ignore whether any actions were taken. Judge the answer text only."""

Evaluate this extracted video frame:

The frame should clearly show the Bugatti Type 44, which features a closed automobile roof.

Scoring:
- Score 1.0 if the text "Type 44" (or "Type44") is visibly present in the frame \
(e.g., as a label, caption, or on-screen text), OR if the Bugatti Type 44 is \
unmistakably identifiable by its visual features.
- Score 0.0 if the text "Type 44" is not visible AND the car is not clearly identifiable, \
or the frame is unrelated.

IMPORTANT: First check explicitly whether the text "Type 44" appears anywhere in the frame."""

The agent was asked to summarize the items purchased and their prices from a shopping video, \

Ground-truth items ({TOTAL} total, item name + price):
""" + "\n".join(
    f"- {name}：{price}元" for name, price in GROUND_TRUTH
) + f"""

Scoring instructions:
- For each of the {TOTAL} items, award 1 point only if BOTH the item name AND price are correctly identified.
- Compute recall = correct_count / {TOTAL}.
- Return a score equal to recall (a float between 0.0 and 1.0).

Important:
- An item is correct only when name and price are both right.
- Minor name variations are acceptable if clearly referring to the same item \
(e.g. "薄切西冷牛排" for "薄切西冷").
- Prices must be numerically correct (e.g. "243" and "243.0" are equivalent, but "243" ≠ "243.09").
- Do NOT give partial credit for an item where only the name or only the price is correct.
NOTE: Ignore whether any actions were taken. Judge the answer text only."""

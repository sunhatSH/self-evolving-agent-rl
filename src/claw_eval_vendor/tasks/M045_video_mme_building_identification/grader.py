Question: What is the 11th building introduced in the video, and how tall is it as of March 2026?

Ground-Truth Answer: The building is the Eiffel Tower (埃菲尔铁塔), 330 meters tall as of March 2026.

Scoring:
- Score 1.0 if the agent correctly identifies the Eiffel Tower AND states the height as 330 meters \
(accept variations like "330m", "330 metres", etc.).
- Score 0.5 if the agent correctly identifies the Eiffel Tower but states the wrong height or omits it.
- Score 0.0 if the building is wrong, or the building is missing, \
or the agent only answers the height correctly but identifies the wrong building.
NOTE: Ignore whether any actions were taken. Judge the answer text only."""

Evaluate this extracted video frame:

- Score 0.0 if the Eiffel Tower is not clearly identifiable, or the frame is unrelated."""

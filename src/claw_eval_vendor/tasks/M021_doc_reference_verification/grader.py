15. RMB: Comprehensively benchmarking reward models in LLM alignment. → ICLR 2025

Start with a base score of 1.0. Apply the following deductions (minimum score 0.0):
- -0.1 pts for each paper in the Ground Truth that is missing from the output,
  or has an incorrect formal venue.
- -0.1 pts for each extra paper included in the output that is NOT in the Ground
  Truth (e.g., papers still on arXiv or hallucinated papers).

Evaluate the CSV output against the ground truth using these criteria.
Output a score between 0.0 and 1.0."""

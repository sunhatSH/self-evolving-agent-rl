There must be exactly two drawings — no more, no less.

Scoring:
- Score 1.0 if ALL of the following are true:
  (a) The drawing of "a person resting their hand on their forehead on yellowish paper" \

  (b) There are exactly TWO drawings total in the frame — not one, not three or more.
  (c) A bookshelf is visible in the background.

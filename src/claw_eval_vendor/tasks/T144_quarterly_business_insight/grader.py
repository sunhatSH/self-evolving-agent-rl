Evaluate the depth of correlation analysis between customer revenue changes and industry dynamics (0.0-1.0).

## Correct Correlation Pairs
1. Dingxin (Software) <-> RSS-901 (Software industry growth 12%) -> industry tailwind driving growth
2. Hanhai (E-Commerce) <-> RSS-902 (E-commerce traffic growth slowing) -> industry slowdown causing flat demand
3. Wantong (Logistics) <-> RSS-903 (Logistics price competition/margin pressure) -> explains price sensitivity and slight decline
4. Qianfeng (Manufacturing) <-> RSS-904 (Manufacturing IT budget tightening) -> industry headwind causing downgrade
5. Sunlight (Media) <-> RSS-905 (Media AI-driven growth) -> AI tailwind driving expansion
6. Public (Government) <-> RSS-906 (Government budget adjustments) -> budget cuts causing churn

## Strict scoring
- 0.9-1.0: All 6 correlation pairs correct, clear causal analysis logic
- 0.7-0.8: At least 4 pairs correct
- 0.5-0.6: 3 pairs correct
- 0.3-0.4: Only 1-2 pairs correct or analysis is superficial
- 0.0-0.2: Did not correlate industry dynamics with customer data

6. Churn review: CUS-906 churned due to budget issues, similar customers need prevention

## Strict scoring

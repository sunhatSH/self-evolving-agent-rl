The following text was saved by an agent as the answer to this question:
"During which time interval does the woman descend from a rocky hill with tall rocks?"

The ground-truth answer is: start = 214 seconds (3:34), end = 220 seconds (3:40).

Your task:
1. Parse the predicted start and end times from the text below, converting any timestamp \
format (e.g. "3:34 - 3:40", "from 3 minutes 34 seconds to 3 minutes 40 seconds", etc.) \
into seconds.
2. Compute IoU = intersection / union of the predicted interval and the ground-truth interval \
[214, 220].
3. Return the IoU value as your score (a float between 0.0 and 1.0). \
If no valid interval can be parsed, return 0.0."""

Evaluate this cropped video frame:

The frame should show a woman descending from a rocky hill with tall rocks. \
The woman wears a red top and a headband, and has a dark blue jacket hanging \
on her black backpack. She should be the main subject, clearly visible and \
centered in the crop.

Scoring:
- Score 1.0 if the woman is clearly visible and centered, wearing a red top, \
and the dark blue jacket on her black backpack is consistent with the descent scene.
- Score 0.5 if the woman is visible but either the crop is not well-centered on her, \
or the red top / jacket+backpack detail is unclear.
- Score 0.0 if the woman is not visible, the red top is absent, the frame is from \
the wrong scene, or the file is empty/corrupt."""

Do not just look at the first turn — evaluate the entire conversation for information gathering depth.

## Batch 1 — Basic Setup (must collect; missing any → cap at 0.7)
  - Design structure: how many between-subjects groups and within-subjects levels
  - Sample sizes per group
  - The specific error message details (singular matrix vs other warnings)
  - Which SPSS procedure was used (GLM Repeated Measures)

## Batch 2 — Design Details (good assistants ask these; each adds points)
  - What is the dependent variable and how is it measured
  - Whether groups were balanced at baseline
  - Number of time points and what they represent
  - Whether the variance patterns differ across groups/time points

## Batch 3 — Deep Investigation (excellent assistants probe here; required for 0.9+)
  - Missing data: how many cases, which time points, what pattern (MCAR/MAR/MNAR)
  - How missing data was handled (listwise deletion vs other methods)
  - Levene's test results at each time point
  - Whether the missingness might be related to the outcome (non-random dropout)

## Scoring
- 1.0: Systematically collected all Batch 1 + most Batch 2 + probed into Batch 3 (missing data pattern, Levene's results)
- 0.8-0.9: All Batch 1 + most Batch 2 + at least 1 Batch 3 item
- 0.7: All Batch 1 collected but no deeper probing
- 0.4-0.6: Batch 1 partially collected (missed sample size or design details)
- 0.1-0.3: Almost no proactive questioning; jumped to generic advice
- 0.0: No clarification behavior at all

Notes:
- If the user proactively provided some information, the assistant only needs to ask about what is missing
- Questions should be natural and systematic, not feel like a checklist interrogation
- Asking about missing data handling and variance patterns is what separates a competent statistician from a generic helper"""

Do not just evaluate the final answer — examine every turn of the conversation.

## Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Diagnostic Reasoning Path
- Did the assistant form and test hypotheses about the root cause of the Box's M error?
- Did the assistant correctly shift from "design matrix problem" (user's framing) to "covariance matrix problem" (actual cause)?
- Did the assistant connect multiple pieces of evidence (small n, unequal variance, missing data) into a coherent diagnosis?

### 2. Information Integration
- When the user revealed variance heterogeneity (Batch 2), did the assistant immediately connect this to Box's M?
- When the user revealed the missing data pattern (high-anxiety dropouts, Batch 3), did the assistant recognize this as potentially MAR/MNAR?
- Did the assistant connect Levene's significance at post/3mo with the variance heterogeneity pattern?

### 3. Tool Usage Quality
- If the assistant used computation tools for df calculations, effect sizes, or power: was the usage efficient and correct?
- If the assistant searched for SPSS documentation or statistical methodology: were queries targeted and results integrated?
- Scoring:
  - Efficient, targeted tool use (1-3 calls with clear purpose): no penalty
  - Moderate tool use (4-5 calls): -0.05
  - Excessive/unfocused tool use (6+ calls) or repeated searches: -0.10 to -0.15
  - No tool use when calculations were needed: -0.10

### 4. Conversation Flow
- Did the assistant ask questions in a logical sequence (basic setup → design details → assumptions → missing data)?
- Did the assistant provide interim insights as information was gathered, or stay silent until the end?
- Did the assistant appropriately handle the user's impatience and manuscript deadline pressure?

### 5. Correction of Misconceptions
- Did the assistant address the user's misconception that "singular design matrix" means a design problem?
- Did the assistant correct the belief that Box's M makes Levene's redundant?
- Did the assistant explain why listwise deletion is problematic in this case?

## Scoring
- 1.0: Every turn demonstrates expert-level diagnostic reasoning; misconceptions corrected diplomatically; tool usage efficient and purposeful
- 0.7-0.9: Good diagnostic path with minor gaps; most misconceptions addressed; tool use reasonable
- 0.4-0.6: Partial diagnosis; some misconceptions uncorrected; tool use inefficient or absent when needed
- 0.1-0.3: Poor diagnostic reasoning; generic advice without connecting to user's specific situation
- 0.0: No meaningful diagnostic trajectory"""

## Scoring Rules (strict — do not let content quality influence this)
- 1.0: All verifiable numbers within tolerance; df structure correct; GG epsilon interpretation correct; effect size conversions correct
- 0.7-0.9: df structure correct; most statistical claims accurate; minor errors in secondary calculations (e.g., exact epsilon bounds)
- 0.4-0.6: Some df values correct but key errors (e.g., wrong error df, incorrect GG threshold, wrong effect size benchmarks)
- 0.2-0.3: Multiple numerical errors; fundamental statistical relationships incorrect
- 0.0-0.1: No numerical content provided, or pervasive errors throughout
- If the assistant states clearly wrong statistical relationships (e.g., "Box's M tests sphericity" or "GG correction threshold is 0.50"), score ≤ 0.3 regardless of other calculations"""

    CONTENT_RUBRIC = """Evaluate the content quality of the assistant's response (0.0-1.0).
Do not consider numerical accuracy — only diagnosis depth, domain knowledge, and recommendation quality.

## Topic Consistency (pre-check)
The topic is diagnosing and resolving a Box's M / singular matrix warning in a 2×4 mixed ANOVA.
If the response is completely off-topic, score 0.

## User's Full Situation (revealed across conversation)
  - 2(treatment vs control) × 4(pre/post/1mo/3mo) mixed ANOVA on anxiety scores
  - ~25 per group, 50 total, 47 after listwise deletion of 3 participants
  - Box's M warning about "singular or nearly singular design matrix"
  - Treatment group variance inflates at post and follow-up time points
  - Levene's test significant at post and 3-month but not pre or 1-month
  - 3 missing participants: 2 had high anxiety at post-test, 1 missed 3-month follow-up
  - User used listwise deletion
  - User dismissed Levene's as redundant with Box's M
  - User prefers SPSS menus over syntax
  - Manuscript revise-and-resubmit due in 3 weeks

## Key Contradictions (high-quality answers should identify and explain)
The user holds several misconceptions that a skilled statistical consultant should address:

1. **"Singular design matrix" ≠ design problem**: The error is actually about the covariance matrix being ill-conditioned, not the design matrix. The real cause is variance heterogeneity combined with small sample sizes making the pooled covariance matrix nearly singular. (+0.05 for identifying this)

2. **Listwise deletion is inappropriate here**: The missingness pattern (high-anxiety dropouts) strongly suggests MAR or MNAR, not MCAR. Listwise deletion under non-MCAR produces biased estimates. Mixed models handle MAR properly via ML/REML. (+0.05 for identifying this)

3. **Levene's is NOT redundant with Box's M**: Box's M tests equality of entire covariance matrices; Levene's tests equality of marginal variances at each time point. Both being significant is compounding evidence of heterogeneity — more concerning than either alone. (+0.05 for explaining this distinction)

## Evaluation Criteria: Complete Decision Chain

### Step 1: Accurate Diagnosis (required — missing this → cap at 0.4)
- Correctly identifies that the error stems from covariance matrix ill-conditioning, not a literal design matrix problem
- Connects small sample + unequal variances + listwise deletion as contributing factors
- Explains why ~25 per group with 4 time points (10 covariance parameters) is marginal

### Step 2: Contradiction Identification and Correction (+0.15 max)
- Corrects "singular design matrix" misconception (+0.05)
- Identifies listwise deletion as inappropriate given non-random missingness (+0.05)
- Explains why Box's M and Levene's are not redundant (+0.05)

### Step 3: Alternative Analysis Recommendation (required — missing this → cap at 0.6)
- Recommends Linear Mixed Model (LMM) as primary alternative
- Explains WHY LMM is better: handles unequal variances, uses all data under MAR assumption, no sphericity requirement, flexible covariance structures
- Provides SPSS menu instructions: Analyze → Mixed Models → Linear

### Step 4: Domain Knowledge Application (each item +0.04)
- **Covariance structure selection**: Mentions unstructured, compound symmetry, AR(1), or heterogeneous options and when to use each (+0.04)
- **ML vs REML estimation**: Explains when to use ML (model comparison) vs REML (parameter estimation) (+0.04)
- **Sphericity and its relationship to this problem**: Explains that sphericity is a special case of compound symmetry and why it matters for repeated measures (+0.04)
- **Power implications**: Discusses how switching from listwise deletion ANOVA to LMM may actually increase power by using all available data (+0.04)
- **Reporting guidance**: Advises on how to report the switch from ANOVA to LMM in the manuscript (reviewer expectations) (+0.04)

### Step 5: Actionable Recommendation (+0.05)
- Gives a clear, specific recommendation tailored to the user's situation (3-week deadline, menu preference, manuscript context)
- Addresses the user's core question: "Are my results unusable?" with a nuanced answer

### Step 6: Practical Steps (+0.04)
- Provides concrete SPSS menu navigation steps for running LMM
- Specifies what options to select (covariance structure, fixed effects, random effects)
- Mentions how to handle the 3 previously-deleted participants (include them back)

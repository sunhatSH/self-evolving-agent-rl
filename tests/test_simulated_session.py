"""Tests for run_simulated_session (SINGLE-TURN mode, 2026-07-23).

The session is now single-turn: the Questioner is NOT called, so each seed
query yields exactly one turn = N slot trajectories (deterministic yield that
fits verl's fixed-size rollout contract). These tests assert the single-turn
contract: one turn, N trajectories, winner picked on graded reward, observer
report feeds the reward judge, winner synced.

The multi-turn tests (K budget / questioner end / patience) are obsolete under
single-turn and were removed. Multi-turn can be re-enabled later via the
(deprecated) cross-batch trajectory pool; see rollout/simulated_session.py
docstring.

"""Observation-grounded reward -- doc §3.3 要点 4 / §6 / §7.4 / O4.

This is the third agent. It does NOT reimplement judge I/O: it reuses
``trainer.model_reward.JudgeClient`` (the OpenAI-compatible frozen judge already
wired into verl's custom_reward_function) and only adds the observation-grounded
rubric/prompt the design left blank (O4).

The judge sees TWO channels, both carried by the one R_t packet:
  - the observer's STATE evidence (deterministic ``state_diff``) -> ground truth for
    completion; anchors reward in the real effect;
  - ``report.actor_trajectory`` -> the actor's actions, carried PASS-THROUGH by the
    observer component (the observer MODEL never sees it -- no token waste) -> used
    to judge safety / robustness (how the agent acted).

Gating (the "几层拦截"): if the turn produced NO effect (empty diff,
``report.has_effect`` False), we SHORT-CIRCUIT and return a zero score WITHOUT
calling the judge -- a turn that changed nothing gets completion 0 for free, and
the expensive judge round-trip is skipped.
